# About the project
Tweetastrophy is a project which classifies tweets accordin to whether they imply a disaster or not. Find the current version of our web-app [here](https://tweetastrophy.streamlit.app/).

(The dataset used for training the underlying machine learning model is obtained from Kaggle competition ["Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets"](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nlp-getting-started).

### Validity of the project
We had an idea to train both DL and ML models, at the end we reached almost the same validation around %80. We decided to go on with the ML model since it is lighter than DL model to implement and also there is no risk for overfitting.
The final, light-weight machine learning model we implemented belongs to the family of Naive-Bayes Classifiers.
